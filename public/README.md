## Background

**Galvanize Eats** is a food service that delivers burgers and pizza on demand. You are building their new site, which includes a light ordering web app. The landing page of the site should tell you some basic information about the company, while the web app should show you a sorted list of menu items, allow you to build an order, enter in your delivery information, and submit the order to Galvanize Eats. Your product owner has created a list of prioritized user stories for you to work down.

## Import stories into Pivotal Tracker

Import this [CSV](https://students-gschool-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/595/Q1_Project_Stories-Galvanize_Eats.csv) into a new project in Pivotal Tracker to get the requirements for this story. The new project should be prefixed with your cohort number. They are sorted into two epics that roughly align with the two pages, and they are prioritized. You may find it useful to size the stories before you begin.

## Use the Galvanize Eats repo as a base

Fork/clone [this repo](https://github.com/gSchool/galvanize-eats). You are required to use this repo and keep this folder structure.

## APIs

The project involves two API calls. The first, to get the menu data should be a GET request to this url: [https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/menu](https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/menu). The second request, to post an order, should be a POST request to this url: [https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/orders](https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/orders).

Your post request should submit the user order. When you have successfully hit the POST api you will see "Congratulations!".
