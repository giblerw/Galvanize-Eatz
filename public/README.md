## Background

**Galvanize Eats** is a food service that delivers burgers and pizza on demand. You are building their new site, which includes a light ordering web app. The landing page of the site should tell you some basic information about the company, while the web app should show you a sorted list of menu items, allow you to build an order, enter in your delivery information, and submit the order to Galvanize Eats. Your product owner has created a list of prioritized user stories for you to work down.
